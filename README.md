# covid-19-visualization
Visualize the rise of COVID-19 cases globally with ggplot2.
Within months, COVID-19 went from an epidemic to a pandemic. From the first identified case in December 2019, how did the virus spread so fast and widely? In this free R project, we will visualize data from the early months of the coronavirus outbreak to see how this virus grew to be a global pandemic. This project assumes you can manipulate data frames using `dplyr` and make plots using `ggplot2`.


This repository contains information, code and results which highlight the spread of COVID-19 across the countries and then a comparison of China against the other countries across the globe.
