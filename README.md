## covid-19-visualization
This repository contains information, code and results which highlight the spread of COVID-19 across the countries and then a comparison of China against the other countries across the globe. We also find out the country with the highest spike in number of cases. The dataset used is dated March-17-2020.
We visualize the rise of COVID-19 cases globally with ggplot2.
As we all have seen and witnessed, within a matter of months, COVID-19 went from an epidemic to a pandemic. Starting from the very first diagnosed case back in December 2019, one question which bothers all of us is "how did the virus spread so fast and widely?" In this R project, I have visualized data from the early months of the COVID-19 outbreak to see how this virus grew to be a global pandemic.
